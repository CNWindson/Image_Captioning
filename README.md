# Image_Captioning
This is a neural network project. The expected function is to generate descriptions for pictures. That is, to provide a picture, the neural network can automatically generate a paragraph of text for the picture to describe the content of it. The project is based on LSTM and CNN, and uses VGG16 to extract image features.
这是一个神经网络项目，期望实现看图说话功能。
